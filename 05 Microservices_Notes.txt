Notes : We should never use models directly in case of microservices. 
        We should you DTO (Data Transfer objects)

       
       Serivces: Implementations (Class that implement interface) : Product Service
                 Create Interfaces inside Service Folder : IProductService
       DTO: ProductDto
       Mapper : ModelConverter (Here we are not using Automapper, it will do the same)
